# ASP.NET

Server-Side Web App: client request a web page from a server, the server processes the request and returns an HTML document to the client's browser.

Client-Side Web App: asks the browser to download the code from the server, based on the web page request sent and execute it locally.

The need for Server-Side programming is based on the following reasons;

1. Isolation - client-side cannot access server-side resources
2. Security - end users cannot view client-side code
3. Thin clients - mobile devices do not support client-side programming platforms such as flash or silverlight
